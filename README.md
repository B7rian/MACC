
# Matrix Accelerator for Snickerdoodle

This project aims to provide an IP block for snickerdoodle that can be used to
offload matrix operations from the Cortex-A9 included in the FPGA. This IP
should work on other Zync-7000 boards but will only be tested on snickerdoodle. 

## Current Specifications

* Project is just getting started - check back soon.

## Target Specifications

* Support for matrices up to 1024 x 1024 in size 
* 8, 16, 32- bit signed or unsigned integer data supported
* Floating-point support TBD based on available Xilinx IP
* Saturating multiply and multiply-accumulate operations. Other functions TBD. 
* Each matrix has its own read/write register to support parallel data input
* 64-bit data interface for matrix load/store (AXI wrapper to be provided later)
* Data processed as soon as it becomes available to minimize latency
* Result from operation can be used in next operation without reading and 
  re-writing the data to a new location
* FPGA cell usage TBD

## Software Interface

### Background

You can skip this section if you just want to get something up and running. 

IÂ´ve seen FFT offload engines on commercially available DSPs that are used
roughly like this:

1. Load matrix data into memory-mapped registers or special RAM
2. Specify some operation to perform
3. Wait for interrupt signalling completion. 

The seperated load and execute steps leave data sitting idle in the registers
while the entire load operation completes, adding latency to the overall 
system design. 

In this design, the setup order is modified to allow it to operate on data 
as soon as it becomes available. 

### High-Level Usage

Input matrices are called matrix A and B.  The result is called matrix C.

1. Specify matrix A and B sizes and an operation via control register. 
2. Load data into engine using memory mapped registers for input matrices.    
    * DMA is recommended to completely offload processor core.  
    * Data is processed by the engine as it is received. 
    * Seperate registers are provided for each input matrix, so multi-stream 
      DMA can be used
    * Data must be loaded a complete row at a time, left to right, 
      top-to-bottom.  
3. A few cycles after all the data is received, computation will be complete
   and and interrupt will fire. Read result out of engine from matrix C
   using PIO or DMA. 

### Register Definition

#### Status 1

Status register 1 can be read to determine the current engine state for 
data input and computation.

STAT Value | Description
--- | ---
0x0 | Idle
0x1 | Receiving data / operation in progress
0x2 | Calculation complete
0x3 | Error 

#### Status 2

Status register 2 can be read to determine the current engine state during 
a data read-out.

Field | Bits | Description
--- | --- | ---
RSVD0 | 63:60 | Reserved

#### Matrix Data In

One of these registers will be defined for each matrix (A, B, and C.)

Data must be right-justified in the register.  Registers are numbered using 
little-endian convention, so data will be in bit 0 to _n - 1_ for data size 
_n_.

Data must be loaded 1 entry at a time in row-major order. Data from a 1D or
3D C array can be loaded in the order the data appears in memory. Packed data 
formats are not currently supported.

To stop the current operation and re-start the operation, write Status 1.

#### Matrix Data Out

This register allows the program to read the data from any matrix 
(A, B, or C.)

Data must be unloaded 1 entry at a time in row-major order.  Packed data 
formats are not currently supported.


# Design Information

## Development Process

HDL designs implemented with FPGAs have a low build cost similar to sotware,
and are suitable for agile developement. 

* TDD is included. Testbenches and tests are written before each feature and 
  are included in the repository
* Releases will be done in small increments
* Test benches will be as UVM-like as they can be without SystemVerilog support.
